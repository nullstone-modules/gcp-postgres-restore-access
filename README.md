# gcp-postgres-restore-access

Grants an app the Postgres access it needs to restore a scrubbed production snapshot over a
database.

This capability mints an instance-admin Postgres role through `pg-db-admin` — which Terraform
cannot reach directly, since the database sits inside a VPC — ensures the target database and its
owner role exist, and publishes the connection and the database names the restore needs.

Everything else is ordinary app configuration. See
[nullstone-io/pg-snapshot](https://github.com/nullstone-io/pg-snapshot) for the tool itself.

## What this capability provides

| | |
|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_URL` (secret) | the restore role, connected to the instance's `postgres` database |
| `RESTORE_TARGET_DATABASE` | the database the restore replaces |
| `RESTORE_OWNER_ROLE` | the role restored objects are owned by |

`pg-snapshot` reads the last two as aliases for `TARGET_DATABASE` and `OWNER_ROLE`. Everything else
the restore needs — the bucket, `MIGRATE_COMMAND`, `BACKUP_RETENTION` — is app configuration.

## Variables

| | |
|---|---|
| `target_database` | database the restore replaces. Defaults to the app name. |

It accepts `{{ NULLSTONE_STACK }}`, `{{ NULLSTONE_BLOCK }}`, `{{ NULLSTONE_APP }}`, and
`{{ NULLSTONE_ENV }}` for interpolation.

The role that owns the restored objects is always the target database name. That is how
`pg-db-admin` names database owners and how `postgres-access` grants every application membership,
so it is the one role restored tables can belong to and still be reachable by the apps. It is not
configurable: naming any other role puts every restored table out of the applications' reach on the
first swap.

The database and the owner role are created only if they do not already exist. An existing database
keeps its owner and settings untouched, and detaching this capability never drops either one.

The role holds membership in the managed superuser role (GCP's) and in the target's owner. It
needs `CREATEDB` to create the staging database *and* to rename databases at all, ownership of
the target to rename it, and the ability to terminate sessions and create non-trusted extensions.
One grant covers all of it.

Production gating is structural: attach this only to apps in environments that restore, and the
role exists nowhere else.

## What a restore does

1. Loads the snapshot into a fresh `restored_<id>` database, so the target is untouched until the
   very end.
2. Runs `MIGRATE_COMMAND` against it, reconciling schema drift — the snapshot carries production's
   migration-tracking table, so your own tool applies exactly the delta.
3. Swaps it into place with two catalog renames, keeping the previous database as
   `<target>_backup_<timestamp>`.

A failure anywhere before the swap discards the staging database and leaves the target exactly as
it was. A crash *during* the swap is recovered on the next run from the catalog itself.
