# gcp-postgres-restore-access

Grants an app the Postgres access it needs to restore a scrubbed production snapshot over a
database.

This capability does **one** thing: it mints an instance-admin Postgres role through
`pg-db-admin` — which Terraform cannot reach directly, since the database sits inside a VPC — and
publishes the connection and the database names the restore needs.

Everything else is ordinary app configuration. See
[nullstone-io/pg-snapshot](https://github.com/nullstone-io/pg-snapshot) for the tool itself.

## What this capability provides

| | |
|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_URL` (secret) | the restore role, connected to the instance's `postgres` database |
| `RESTORE_TARGET_DATABASE` | the database the restore replaces |
| `RESTORE_OWNER_ROLE` | the role restored objects are owned by |
| `RESTORE_BACKUP_RETENTION` | how many previous versions of the target to keep |

The role holds membership in the managed superuser role (GCP's) and in the target's owner. It
needs `CREATEDB` to create the staging database *and* to rename databases at all, ownership of
the target to rename it, and the ability to terminate sessions and create non-trusted extensions.
One grant covers all of it.

Production gating is structural: attach this only to apps in environments that restore, and the
role exists nowhere else.

## What a restore does

1. Loads the snapshot into a fresh `restored_<id>` database, so the target is untouched until the
   very end.
2. Runs `MIGRATE_COMMAND` against it, reconciling schema drift — the snapshot carries production's
   migration-tracking table, so your own tool applies exactly the delta.
3. Swaps it into place with two catalog renames, keeping the previous database as
   `<target>_backup_<timestamp>`.

A failure anywhere before the swap discards the staging database and leaves the target exactly as
it was. A crash *during* the swap is recovered on the next run from the catalog itself.
